Finetune LLM the entire model, Adapters and QLoRA techniques using Pytorch/hugging face libraries

Use the AGNews business dataset to finetune the LLM to generate text in business style. 
   Verify the LLM response using the sample prompt. 

Develop adapters for NLP tasks like Text Classification, Sentiment analysis and NER by finetuning the Llama model.
Verify the performance of the merged model with 10% parameters against finetuning performance of all LLM parameters on NLP tasks.

Use LoRA and QLoRA techniques to finetune the TinyLlama model to follow instructions. 
  Use the UltraChatDataset to train the Model and Verify the LLM response for the Instruction dataset.
