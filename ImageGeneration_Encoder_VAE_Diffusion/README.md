1. Build and Train auto encoder and decoder model to represent MNIST images in the latent space. 
Generate new MNIST images by sampling the latent space of 16-bit vector to 28x28  image

2. Build and Train Variation Auto Encoder model to represent MNIST images in the latent space. 
Capture the Mean and Variance of the random variable in the latent space. Generate new MNIST 
images by sampling the data points from the random variable to MNIST images.

3. Build and Train diffusion models using UNET2D model on MNIST data and generate new images by 
denoising the gaussian noise.
