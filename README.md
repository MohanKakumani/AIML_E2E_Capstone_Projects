Use Transfer Learning based on VGG16 Model with custom top layers to detect Covid-19 based on chest X-Ray image whether the patient is having Covid, Pneumonia or Normal.

Improve the model performance with Data Parallelism, Data augmentation, Dropout and Early stopping/Saving the best model using Callbacks.

Deploy the model as an Endpoint using Sagemaker Endpoint configuration in AWS and monitor the performance metrics in Amazon cloud watch
